# Birthday Board - Raspberry Pi enhanced Penny Board

Build for the Raspberry Pi 4th Birthday Weekend on March 5/6 2016 in Cambridge. It creates a hotspot and to which you can connect to. You then can record a birthday message and upload it to the pi. With the button on the pi the message can then be played back. 


## Bill of Material

* A Red Arcade Button
* a penny board
* white, green and red filament PLA
* a Pi (we used a Pi 2)
* a little speaker
* a lipo Battery
* a Power Boost to get the 3.7V of the lipo to 5V
* Resistors
* Jumper Cables
* Dremel
* double sided tape



## How to make it?

### Preparing the Board

By a cheap penny board that has its logo in a circle in the middle.

I first used the dremel to get the logos away from the top of the board and the buttom. 

I then drilled a hole in the middle of the logo for the led and a hole in the back of the boad for the button.


### 3D Printing

I used my 3D Printer to create a pi logo in red, green and white and also created a pi holder to keep the pi in place and also a little box to elavate the battery booster.  


### Electronics

Connect the wires to the button and change the led resistor. I used a 110 Ohm one. 

Connect the cables to the pis pins.
